## Functional requirements (features)

- **Sending a message**: POST request to an API endpoint consisting of
- **Receiving a message**: GET request to an API endpoint
- **Acknowledging a message**: PATCH request to an API endpoint


## Non functional requirements

## Capacity Estimation

- 1,000,000,000 users per month
- 1:1 read to write ratio per second
- 5 uploads a second * 31,536,000 seconds in a year = 157,680,000 uploads per year, each upload is an average of 2 KB so we need around 320 GB of storage per year.
